### Bugs

### Breaking Changes

### Improvements

* `tm_get_suspensions()` and `tm_get_risk_of_suspensions()` added. (0.6.7.0000) ([#411](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/411))
* `fb_player_info()` added. (0.6.7.0001) ([#47](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/47))

* In addressing the issue with `tm_player_injury_history()` in [#375](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/375), the previously names column `club` has been renamed `club_missed_games_for` to better represent that this column will contain the games the player missed games for, as previously this column could have been misunderstood to be who they were playing for when they were injured (0.6.5.0004)

* All fotmob functions updated to use `httr::GET()` with appropriate post-processing of JSON instead of `jsonlite::fromJSON()` with raw URLs (0.6.3.0000) [#262](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/262)

### Improvements

* `LEAGUES` replaces **if** statement with list (0.6.2.3000) [#232](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/pull/232)
* `tm_player_transfer_history()` added more information, added possibility to skip extraction of info that requires additional page load time. (0.6.2.4000) [#235](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/pull/235)
* `fb_league_stats()` added. Gets season stats for all teams / players in a selected league from FBref in a single scrape. (0.6.2.6000) [#243](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/pull/243)
* `fb_league_stats()` uses `rvest::htm_table()` if `team_or_player = "table"` (faster and more reliable), and only uses chromote if `team_or_player = "player"`. (0.6.2.7100)
* Use `quiet = FALSE` in all `purrr::possibly()` calls internally. Improve messaging for unexpected outcomes in `fotmob_get_matches_by_date()` and `fotmob_get_match_info()`. (0.6.2.8000) [#244](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/pull/244)

* `fotmob_get_match_players()` returns stats as characters [#150](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/150)

To respect FBref's rate limiting rules, all functions have now been updated to have a default pause of three seconds between page loads, up from two seconds which was originally requested.

### Bugs

* `get_match_report()` and `get_advanced_match_stats()` - now reporting the match date and away team name again. Additionally, `Home_Goals` and `Away_Goals` text strings now clean strings (tabs and line breaks removed) [#128](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/128)
* `fotmob_get_league_ids()` - now uses new endpoint for league ids (data in script element no longer has data). This function is internally used by `fotmob_get_league_matches()`, `fotmob_get_league_tables()`, and `fotmob_get_season_stats()`, which would have been broken if `cached=FALSE` was specified.
* `player_transfer_history()` no longer throwing errors for retired players and also addressed changed HTML on transfermarkt returning no data [#127](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/127)


***

# worldfootballR 0.5.3

### Improvements

Now starting to have load functions:

* `load_match_results()` - function to load pre stored data similar to `get_match_results()`
* `load_fb_big5_advanced_season_stats()` - function to load pre stored data similar to `fb_big5_advanced_season_stats()`


### Bugs

* `player_transfer_history()` updated after html changes on Transfermarkt caused function to return zero row data frame [#120](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/120)
* `fotmob_get_league_matches()` and `fotmob_get_league_tables()` after changes to names in JSON response (`fixtures` -> `matches`, `tableData` -> `table`) [#121](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/121), [#122](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/122)
* Various fotmob functions affected by addition of `api/` in URL
* New names to player stats outdated docs for `fotmob_get_season_stats()`


***

# worldfootballR 0.5.2

### Improvements

* `fotmob_get_league_matches` and `fotmob_get_league_tables` now check 2 places for the league endpoint since it changes occasionally.
* `fotmob_get_match_players` gets 3 additional columns: `match_id`, `team_id`, `team_name`. [#105](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/105)
* `fotmob_get_season_stats` gains `stat_league_name` and can now be used for all leagues since seasons are programmatically scraped
* `tm_player_bio()` now also returns the player's maximum valuation (`max_player_valuation`) and the date that max valuation was recorded (`max_player_valuation_date`). **Note:** there will now be an additional two columns to the output
* Additional processing logic added such that `fotmob_get_league_tables` works properly for international tournaments.
* The `stat_type` argument in `fotmob_get_seasons_stats` renamed to `stat_name` to reflect the different set of values that it takes. Valid values are now equivalent to the options that can be found on the stats page in the browser, e.g. [the Liverpool player stats page](https://www.fotmob.com/leagues/47/stats/season/16390/players/goals/team/8650/liverpool-players).
* All FBref functions now contain a user defined pause (`time_pause`) before each page load to abide by their new rate limiting rules. See [here](https://www.sports-reference.com/bot-traffic.html). Default is set to `2` seconds
* Internal function`.get_each_season_results()` exported now


### Bugs

* `tm_player_bio` returning player number instead of name and also NAs for valuation [#109](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/issues/109)
* `fotmob_get_match_players` failed for non-domestic leagues because the `team` element does id not exist under the `table` element. Fix is to have more robust element for assigning team ids for players.
* `fotmob_get_seasons_stats` failed for non-domestic leagues, even when setting `cached=TRUE`. Fix was to add logic such that the latest season for a given league is found from the "See More" links on a generic stats page.
