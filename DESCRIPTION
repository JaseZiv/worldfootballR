Description: A set of functions to allow users to obtain clean and tidy
    football (soccer) game, team and player data. Data is collected from a
    number of popular sites, including 'FBref'<https://fbref.com/en/>,
    transfer and valuations data from
    'Transfermarkt'<https://www.transfermarkt.com/> and shooting location
    data from 'Understat'<https://understat.com/>. It gives users the
    ability to access data more efficiently, rather than having to export
    data tables to files before being able to complete their analysis.
