Description: Allow users to obtain clean and tidy
    football (soccer) game, team and player data. Data is collected from a
    number of popular sites, including 'FBref',
    transfer and valuations data from
    'Transfermarkt'<https://www.transfermarkt.com/> and shooting location
    and other match stats data from 'Understat'<https://understat.com/>.
    It gives users the ability to access data more efficiently, rather than
    having to export data tables to files before being able to complete their
    analysis.
