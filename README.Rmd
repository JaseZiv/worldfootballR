## Overview

This package is designed to allow users to extract various world football results and player statistics from the following popular football (soccer) data sites:

* [FBref](https://fbref.com/)
* [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/)
* [Understat](https://understat.com/)


## Installation

As at 2024-06-29, we are no longer including instructions to install from CRAN. The version pushed to CRAN is very much out of date, and with very regular updates to this library, we advise installing from GitHub only.

You can install the released version of [**```worldfootballR```**](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR/) from [GitHub](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JaseZiv/worldfootballR")
```


```{r load_libs, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(worldfootballR)
```

***

### Loading Data

<img src="https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR_data/blob/master/man/figures/logo.png" align="center" width="181" height="201"/>

Since the release of `v0.5.3`, the library now supports very rapid loading of pre-collected data through the use of `load_` functions.

The data available for loading is stored in the `worldfootballR_data` repository. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR_data).

Head to the vignette [here](https://jaseziv.github.io/worldfootballR/articles/load-scraped-data.html) to see examples of which data is available for rapid loading.

Note that fotmob data is no longer provided since the release of `v0.6.4` due to a change in their [terms of service](https://www.fotmob.com/tos.txt).
